        <p> “Actions speak louder than words.” Just one of the many sayings my father always said. He had a few he liked, but I believe this was his favorite. He is a very proud man, with great morals. He served in the Vietnam War in the Marine core. He is the type of man where you never had to guess how he felt, he was more than happy to let you know.</p>
